# IMDb-exploration

A project made for Data Visualization class where we clean and explore the IMDb dataset in order to find what makes a TV series successful.

To complement the data, we also ended up cleaning and exploring the dataset "TV shows on Netflix, Prime Video, Hulu and Disney+" by user Ruchi Bhatia on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ruchi798/tv-shows-on-netflix-prime-video-hulu-and-disney

This project was a team assignment so this repository only includes my part of the code as well as the full report.
